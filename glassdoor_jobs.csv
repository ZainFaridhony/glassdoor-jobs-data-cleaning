Data Scientist (Generalist),$128K - $141K (Glassdoor est.),"PicnicHealth is a San Francisco-based, venture-backed health tech startup with the mission of structuring the world's medical data to make it useful. Our business is two-sided: We give patients the first truly useful and complete personal health record by doing all the legwork to collect, digitize, and organize medical records from all of their providers. In addition, patients can support new medical breakthroughs if they choose to contribute their anonymized medical histories to studies PicnicHealth sponsors with leading researchers. Patients get the PicnicHealth service free of charge, life sciences researchers get critical data on how diseases look in the real world, and academic researchers get free access to data sets that drive cutting edge medical research.

It's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team - we just announced our Series B raise and are growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people. We 3x'd our ARR two years in a row now and on track to continue this trend, building partnerships with over a dozen Life Sciences groups, including 3 of the top 6 Biopharma firms in the US. We're going through a period of hyper-growth - we tripled the size of the team in the last 18 months and we're looking to at least double over the next year. We have a collaborative and engaged team culture that is mission driven and excited about the technology we're building and real solutions we're offering patients.



We are looking for both individual contributors as well as a data science team lead. At PicnicHealth, data science is at the core of how we cost-effectively retrieve and transform medical records into structured shareable data. Our teams recruit patients to partner's research studies, manage a large workforce of professionals who lend their expertise to the process of extracting clinical information, and build software tools to make these processes efficient. We are building up our team of talented data scientists to arm these teams with data-driven insights to make informed operational and strategic decisions. This role provides a unique opportunity to work with continuous real-world operations data, to be tightly coupled to the actions taken based on one's analyses, and to drive significant impact within PicnicHealth's core business.

Based in Los Angeles, Yumi is a nutrition brand transforming the way parents approach mealtime with healthier meals and content tailored to your baby and delivered direct to your door.

A passionate team of parents, nutritionists, engineers and people who are simply committed to a healthier future, we were appalled by the glut of highly processed, nutrient poor options at the grocery store. We believe families deserve better options especially for the first 1,000 days -- a period recognized by the scientific community as the most important period in a human's life for nutrition and development. Through nutrition and content rooted in science, we want to help parents connect the dots between food and development and raise the standards of the entire market for childhood nutrition. We're well-funded, rapidly-growing and sparking a national movement that's transforming a $48 billion industry.

If you're stoked by our mission and have an entrepreneurial-go-get-em-fire, we'd love to add you to the fam. Let's raise a healthier generation together!

We're looking for data scientists to join the team who are excited about applying their analytical skills to improve our baby food and influence decision making. If you are naturally data curious, excited about deriving insights from data, and motivated by creating healthier, happier future generations, we want to hear from you.

Principal Data Scientist,$122K - $191K (Glassdoor est.),"WHAT WE DO
Imagine if every time you went to the doctor you paid cash upfront before you are treated, where every time you rented an apartment you paid 2 years cash upfront, or where your monthly paycheck is frequently delayed for months at a time. Then imagine doing that without a loan, credit card, or even bank accounts. This is everyday life for over 3 billion people in developing countries around the world. We are Migo, and we are on a mission to change this by re-inventing the way people access and use credit.

Through a simple API integration to our platform, companies can enable their customers to make purchases and pay bills on credit, or get personal loans. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on customer phone records, bank records, and payment transactions to assess credit risk, enabling us to offer credit lines to individuals and small businesses. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards. Because of our proprietary data and innovative technical solutions, Migo is able to provide credit to underbanked customers who are not typically covered by credit bureaus, a critical area of growth for developing countries.",3.5,Migo,"San Francisco, CA",Unknown,-1,-1,-1,-1,Unknown / Non-Applicable

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech company powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices, as well as remotely. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.





At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to work with partners from across our company (actuarial, claims, marketing, telematics, and underwriting) to scale an effective business. This role will provide technical leadership in data practices, modeling infrastructure/architecture, and algorithmic design as a core member of a growing team. Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies.

Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

If you are excited by the opportunity to explore diverse data sources and work on impactful projects central to our company's mission, we'd love to hear from you.

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.





At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to work with partners from across our company (actuarial, claims, marketing, telematics, and underwriting) to scale an effective business. Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies. Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful.

We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.





At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to take on industry-defining problems in collecting, processing, and using telematics data. Your models will have an outsized impact in shaping our understanding of how driver behavior relates to risk, enabling dynamic customer experiences, and powering our pricing strategies.

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world's information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world's information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp's mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser's desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.
