Around 20% of Americans experience depression and/or anxiety each year, yet fewer than half of people with depression get care and only a fraction of those who receive care get even minimally adequate treatment.

Brightside (www.brightside.com) offers expert, best practice, personalized care for depression and anxiety, from the comfort of home. We use over 100 data points about each patient and our PrecisionRx tool to determine the medication thats best, then closely measure and monitor at each step, adjusting medication and dose until its just right. We have a massive and unique data set about depression and anxiety treatments and outcomes.

Were getting phenomenal results: 83% of Brightside members experience a clinically significant symptom reduction and 60% achieve remission levels within 12 weeks. Our mission is to deliver life changing depression and anxiety care to everyone who needs it.

But theres so much more we can do with data to deliver better care and better outcomes to people in need. We can help our members (patients), therapists, and doctors make the most informed decisions at every step in the care cycle, helping each individual get the right treatment and the best results.

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech company powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices, as well as remotely. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.





At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to work with partners from across our company (actuarial, claims, marketing, telematics, and underwriting) to scale an effective business. This role will provide technical leadership in data practices, modeling infrastructure/architecture, and algorithmic design as a core member of a growing team. Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies.

Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

If you are excited by the opportunity to explore diverse data sources and work on impactful projects central to our company's mission, we'd love to hear from you.

About Yumi

Based in Los Angeles, Yumi is a nutrition brand transforming the way parents approach mealtime with healthier meals and content tailored to your baby and delivered direct to your door.

A passionate team of parents, nutritionists, engineers and people who are simply committed to a healthier future, we were appalled by the glut of highly processed, nutrient poor options at the grocery store. We believe families deserve better options especially for the first 1,000 days -- a period recognized by the scientific community as the most important period in a human's life for nutrition and development. Through nutrition and content rooted in science, we want to help parents connect the dots between food and development and raise the standards of the entire market for childhood nutrition. We're well-funded, rapidly-growing and sparking a national movement that's transforming a $48 billion industry.

If you're stoked by our mission and have an entrepreneurial-go-get-em-fire, we'd love to add you to the fam. Let's raise a healthier generation together!

We're looking for data scientists to join the team who are excited about applying their analytical skills to improve our baby food and influence decision making. If you are naturally data curious, excited about deriving insights from data, and motivated by creating healthier, happier future generations, we want to hear from you.

On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.





At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Senior Data Scientist to take on industry-defining problems in collecting, processing, and using telematics data. Your models will have an outsized impact in shaping our understanding of how driver behavior relates to risk, enabling dynamic customer experiences, and powering our pricing strategies. Data is our product; robustly handling a rapidly evolving set of data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. As one example project, you might test the power of different accelerometer-based features to predict accidents and develop an ongoing process to generate those features in real-time for incoming data streams.

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world's information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world's information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp's mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser's desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.
